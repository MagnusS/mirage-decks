    ## ...To deep-sea diving

    Traditional systems programming has involved building services in
    *one* environment.  A modern programmer deals with diverse targets:

    - **Cloud services** with unpredictable traffic spikes and failures.
    - **Smartphone programming** on ARM/x86 with power budgets.
    - **JavaScript** user interfaces with asynchronous web clients.
    - **Internet of Things** devices that have little ARM M0 processors.
    - **Kernel modules** to extend operating system functionality.

    <br />
    Little opportunity for code re-use across these.

    ## Multiscale Principles

    Can we **disentangle the application from the operating system**?


    - Break up core OS logic into modular libraries.

    - Do not assume the presence of an ambient operating system kernel in application code.

    - Develop on Unix, but compile specialized microkernels for production use.

    ## Multiscale Programming

    Can we disentangle the application from the operating system?

    - We chose **OCaml** for its powerful module system and simple runtime semantics.

    - Applications are **functors** (higher-order modules) across their OS dependencies.

    - Compilation is a **staged specialization** process until the target is reached.

    ## Introducing MirageOS

    These slides are written in a library operating system called [MirageOS](http://openmirage.org):

    - Hosted on a <b>~1MB Xen microkernel written in statically
    type-safe OCaml</b>, including the device drivers, TCP and HTTP stack.

    - The application logic was just a <b>couple of source files</b>, written
     as a portable functor independent of OS dependencies.

    - The kernel is <b>running on the public cloud</b> on Amazon EC2, with
    the binaries small enough to be tracked in Git.

    > "An operating system is a collection of software that manages computer

    <br />
    While this traditionally means a monolithic OS such as Linux or Windows,
    it can also describe a **library operating system**.

    - Every OS service exposed as a library with few ambient services.
    - Application links directly with the drivers to boot (a *"unikernel"*)
    - A natural fit to the ML module system.

`CONSOLE` is a *module type* that defines the structure of any console.

`C` is an *module argument* that implements the `CONSOLE` signature.

`MAIN` is a *functor* that is parameterized by a `CONSOLE` module.

      ## Experiences with 1.0

      + __OCaml is the baseline language for all new code__
        + Our C runtime is small, and getting smaller.
        + Is fully event-driven and non-preemptive.
        + Safe modularity at scale is incredible.
      + __Rewriting protocols wasn&rsquo;t that hard__
        + An extremely useful learning experience.
        + Clean slate often highlights research opportunities.
        + Pickup by industry has been vital.
      + __Unikernels fit perfectly on the cloud__
        + Internet protocol building blocks.

      ## Lessons learnt from 1.0

      + **Open source tech transfer was vital**
        + Community (industry+academia) is driving adoption.
        + No one group can build something of this scale.
      + **No distributed computing model**
        + Single vCPU unikernels are useful but limited.
        + Next version must include a distribution model.
        + But which one?
      + **Too specialized to Xen**
        + Library model requires at least one other backend.
        + The (virtual) hardware panopticon is bewildering.
        + Need a flexible foreign function interface to legacy code.

      ## To the Edge of the Cloud

      The library OS approach is far more general than just cloud programming.

      - **ARMv6/Raspberry Pi** - needs device drivers for framebuffer/USB
      - **kernel/FreeBSD** - OS environment is a kernel module
      - **JavaScript/browser** - map WebSockets/HTML5 Storage
      - **ARMv8/Xen** - emerging support for new ARM hypervisors
      - **VMWare/KVM/LXC** - more hypervisor boot libraries
      - **Unix/Capsicum/CHERI** - secure capability hardware

      - __Personal Hosting__ ([User Centric Networking](http://usercentricnetworking.eu))

        - ARM Raspberry Pi protocol servers.
        - Doesn't require a dedicated central security team.

      - __Network as a Service__ (EPSRC, EU FP7 Trilogy 2)

      ## Code and Data in Git

      **Irmin** is our *library database* that follows the modular
      design principles of MirageOS: <https://github.com/mirage/irmin>

      <br />

      - Application stores data in an **immutable DAG** (filesystem-like).
      - Distributed VMs can **fork and merge** the graph.
      - Datastructures are built up with **precise consistency semantics**.
      - **Backend support** for in-memory, Git and HTTP/REST stores.

      <br/>Mirage unikernels thus version control all their data,
      and have a **distributed provenance graph** of all activities.

      ## Usecase: Irmin to control Xen

      - Coordinating Xen VMs is **security- and latency-critical**, and
        errors affect hundreds of millions of deployments.

      - Extremely **hard to debug distributed protocols**, with subtle transaction semantics.

      - We ported the toolstack ported to OCaml *(ICFP 2009)*, and now Mirage/Irmin. 
      <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSzvFwIVm5s>

      - Step on the path towards **dust clouds** of millions of unikernels running for seconds.

     ## Everything is distributed 

     The world is moving towards **multiscale distribution**:

     * Multikernels (Barrelfish) demonstrated this for multicore.
     * Web architectures are multihop client/server.
     * Big data processing requires clusters of commodity computers.

     <br />
     But what about other areas?  MirageOS can be embedded *within*
     a kernel, or inside a BIOS, and other exotic locations.

     **A consensus on disaster waiting to happen?**

     ## Interfacing with foreign code

     Downside of library OS approach is trusting all local code.
     Foreign function interface is still possible though!

     <br />
     Key insight is to **treat the C ABI just like a network protocol**.

       + Describe the *structure* of the foreign C functions.
       + Abstract across *how to link* and invoke them.

     <br />
     This is the **Cmeleon** library in MirageOS 2.0.

    ## Example Binding

This C code:

```
int sigemptyset(sigset_t *set);
int sigfillset(sigset_t *set);
int sigaddset(sigset_t *set, int signum);
int sigdelset(sigset_t *set, int signum);
int sigismember(const sigset_t *set, int signum);
```

is bound in Cmeleon by:

```
let sigemptyset = foreign "sigemptyset" (ptr sigset_t @-> returning int)
let sigfillset = foreign "sigfillset" (ptr sigset_t @-> returning int)
let sigaddset = foreign "sigaddset" (ptr sigset_t @-> int @-> returning int)
let sigdelset = foreign "sigdelset" (ptr sigset_t @-> int @-> returning int)

       ## Summary
 
       > Unikernels combine the best of virtualization, programming languages and library OS techniques to deliver a way of building systems that can withstand the evolution of hardware and software.

       <br />

       * Emphasis on **functional correctness** in the small via modular libraries.
       * **Explicit modularity** assembles small components into large systems.
       * Provides a **migration path** from the Unix world to the unikernel one.
