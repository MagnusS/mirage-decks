      ## Outline

      + Mirage
      + Signposts
      + <http://keybase.io>
      + UCN Work @ Nottingham
    </script>

      ## UCN Goals

      + Build and deploy Nymote
      + Living on the edge (network)
      + Secure, delay-tolerant naming, storage and computation with **useful applications** for end-users.

      Eventually an app store (a 0install one?!)

      ## Mirage status

      Works great on x86_64/Xen, and several self-hosting installations now (including this deck).
      Three new backends relevant to Nymote:

      + Xen/ARM: requires modern ARM chip (Cubieboard)
      + kFreeBSD: prototype exists, needs upstreaming.  Will boot us on Raspberry Pi
      + JavaScript: iocamljs can host apps "in the browser" now.
      
    </script>
  </section>

  <section data-markdown>
    <script type="text/template">
      ## Mirage Xen/ARM

      Preferred deployment target, since no new drivers need to be written (unlike rPi).

      + Needs upstream MiniOS/ARM port.
      + Clean up our x86-specific runtime to use Ctypes
      + OCaml has good ARM code generation already, so rest should just work.
    </script>
  </section>

  <section data-markdown>
    <script type="text/template">
      ## Mirage JavaScript

      + Very useful teaching tool, but what else is it for?
      + Is JS a viable target for applications like e-mail?
    </script>
  </section>

  <section data-markdown>
    <script type="text/template">
      ## Mirage usability

      + Still a fairly raw interface to an OCaml newcomer.
      + Not intended to face the user of course; infrastructure only.
      + Increasing number of tracing tools being built.

      Mirage tutorial day interest?

      ## Signposts

      We want control of our online identities.

      Use DNS to enable __personal clouds__, making it easy to deploy apps that
      function securely and efficiently using our personal devices, connected
      via the Internet edge.

      Rely on DNS manipulation. But that's ok:

      > "DNS servers can play games. As long as they appear to deliver a
      > syntactically correct response to every query, they can fiddle the
      > semantics."<span style="padding-left: 1em">&mdash; RFC3234</span>

      + Active Edge Resolution: DNS
      + Identity Management: DNS
      + Programming Model

      ## Architecture

      ![Signposts architecture](./arch.png)

      At the edge, devices interconnect using tunnels created in response to
      authenticated, confidential DNSCurve queries. Connections
      access-controlled via authenticated query source.

    </script>
  </section>

  <section data-markdown>
    <script type="text/template">
      ## Active Edge Resolution

      + Incremental, parallel resolution via 0 TTL responses containing
        multiple results
      + Bootstrap trusted public keys between devices via resurrecting
        duckling; no passwords during resolution
      + Degrade gracefully from P2P to personal cloud service to shared
        provider
      + Resolution triggers tunnel establishment scripts; currently support
        (__L2__) Tuntap/SSH, OpenVPN, (__L3__) IPSec, (__L4+__) Privoxy/Tor
        via SOCKS
      + Seamless operation with extra host support (e.g., OpenFlow)
    </script>

  <section data-markdown>
    <script type="text/template">
      ## Identity Management

      + Automatic, internal key management in a personal trust hierarchy
        simplifies hygiene
      + TSIG/SIG0 DNSSEC signatures used to demonstrate subnamespace authority
      + Manage keys for SSH, PGP, *Curve in parallel
      + Provides low-friction revocation, making roll-over usable by mortals
        (?)
    </script>

  <section data-markdown>
    <script type="text/template">
      ## Programming Model

      Currently: Sockets API decouples <tt>getaddrinfo(3)</tt> from
      <tt>connect(2)</tt>, so less powerful

      &nbsp;

      With Signposts:

      + Applications bind names to flows in one call, separating connection
        establishment from data transfer
      + Signpost nodes select environmentally optimal routes via long-poll
        DNSCurve updates
      + Signpost resolver proxies DNS on <tt>localhost</tt>, late-binding
        lookups only when traffic is sent (e.g., <tt>TCP SYN</tt>)

      ## <http://keybase.io>

      Public key directory.

      Will store private keys if you let them.  
      _(encrypted, possibly using in-browser crypto)_

      Social network proof-of-identity (github, twitter).

      API exists, under rapid development.
