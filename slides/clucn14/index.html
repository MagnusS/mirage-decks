      ## User-Centric Networking, UCN

      EU FP7-ICT-2013-10-1.6 STREP.

        <h3>Fundamental research challenge:</h3>
        <p>
          how to re-center future connected media services on the user and
          develop improved content recommendation and content delivery
          frameworks by taking into account rich user context information.
          ...
          how to enable intuitive and frictionless interaction with networked
          multimedia applications and services.

      ## The Goal

      The goal of this project is to design a __UCN system architecture for
      user-centric connected media services__. We will build UCN upon three
      complementary research pillars:

      1. understanding user context,
      2. profiling and predicting user interests,
      3. and personalizing content delivery.

      &nbsp;
      The key enabling abstraction in the UCN vision is that of a "Personal
      Information Hub" (PIH).

    </script>

  <section data-markdown>
    <script type="text/template">
      ## Personal Information Hub

      We will construct a __scalable, provenance-tracking__ Private Storage
      Container that can hold a __lifetime's worth of personal data__, and
      __provide fast search capabilities to other services__.

      The Private Storage Container will likely __reside in a non-expert,
      resource-constrained environment__. It needs to be __largely
      self-configuring__ and to __integrate power-management and sleep modes__,
      where appropriate.

      ## Signposts

      We want control of our online identities.

      Use DNS to enable __personal clouds__, making it easy to deploy apps that
      function securely and efficiently using our personal devices, connected
      via the Internet edge.

      Rely on DNS manipulation. But that's ok:

      > syntactically correct response to every query, they can fiddle the
      > semantics."<span style="padding-left: 1em">&mdash; RFC3234</span>

      ## Architecture

      ![Signposts architecture](./arch.png)

      At the edge, devices interconnect using tunnels created in response to
      authenticated, confidential DNSCurve queries. Connections
      access-controlled via authenticated query source.

      ## Key Components

      Active Name Resolution

      Identity Management



      Active Edge Resolution

      + Incremental, parallel resolution via 0 TTL responses containing
        multiple results
      + Bootstrap trusted public keys between devices via resurrecting
        duckling; no passwords during resolution
      + Degrade gracefully from P2P to personal cloud service to shared
        provider
      + Resolution triggers tunnel establishment scripts; currently support
        (__L2__) Tuntap/SSH, OpenVPN, (__L3__) IPSec, (__L4+__) Privoxy/Tor
        via SOCKS
      + Seamless operation with extra host support (e.g., OpenFlow)


      ## Identity Management

      + Automatic, internal key management in a personal trust hierarchy
        simplifies hygiene
      + TSIG/SIG0 DNSSEC signatures used to demonstrate subnamespace authority
      + Manage keys for SSH, PGP, *Curve in parallel
      + Provides low-friction revocation, making roll-over usable by mortals
        (?)

      ## Programming Model

      Currently: Sockets API decouples <tt>getaddrinfo(3)</tt> from
      <tt>connect(2)</tt>, so less powerful

      &nbsp;

      With Signposts:

      + Applications bind names to flows in one call, separating connection
        establishment from data transfer
      + Signpost nodes select environmentally optimal routes via long-poll
        DNSCurve updates
      + Signpost resolver proxies DNS on <tt>localhost</tt>, late-binding
        lookups only when traffic is sent (e.g., <tt>TCP SYN</tt>)

      Public key directory.

      Will store private keys &mdash; (encrypted, possibly using in-browser
      crypto) &mdash; if you let them.

      Social network proof-of-identity (github, twitter) and id relationships.

      API exists, under rapid development.

      ## Data Collection

      Helping to build a better HostView. Want to identify __activities__ in
      (augmented) network data.

      Collation of multiple data sources, but require ground truth for
      labelling ([W-MUST'11, Brundell et
      al](http://www.cs.nott.ac.uk/~rmm/papers/pdf/wmust11-homework.pdf).)

      Ethnographic studies, including presentation of trace data back to
      participants for interactive labelling.

      UK ethics approval in process. French process awaits.
