      We want control of our online identities.

      Use DNS to enable __personal clouds__, making it easy to deploy apps that
      function securely and efficiently using our personal devices, connected
      via the Internet edge.

      Rely on DNS manipulation. But that's ok:

      > syntactically correct response to every query, they can fiddle the
      > semantics."<span style="padding-left: 1em">&mdash; RFC3234</span>

      ## Architecture

      ![Signposts architecture](./arch.png)

      At the edge, devices interconnect using tunnels created in response to
      authenticated, confidential DNSCurve queries. Connections
      access-controlled via authenticated query source.

      ## Active Edge Resolution

      + Incremental, parallel resolution via 0 TTL responses containing
        multiple results
      + Bootstrap trusted public keys between devices via resurrecting
        duckling; no passwords during resolution
      + Degrade gracefully from P2P to personal cloud service to shared
        provider
      + Resolution triggers tunnel establishment scripts; currently support
        (__L2__) Tuntap/SSH, OpenVPN, (__L3__) IPSec, (__L4+__) Privoxy/Tor
        via SOCKS
      + Seamless operation with extra host support (e.g., OpenFlow)

      ## Identity Management

      + Automatic, internal key management in a personal trust hierarchy
        simplifies hygiene
      + TSIG/SIG0 DNSSEC signatures used to demonstrate subnamespace authority
      + Manage keys for SSH, PGP, *Curve in parallel
      + Provides low-friction revocation, making roll-over usable by mortals
        (?)

      ## Programming Model

      Currently: Sockets API decouples <tt>getaddrinfo(3)</tt> from
      <tt>connect(2)</tt>, so less powerful

      &nbsp;

      With Signposts:

      + Applications bind names to flows in one call, separating connection
        establishment from data transfer
      + Signpost nodes select environmentally optimal routes via long-poll
        DNSCurve updates
      + Signpost resolver proxies DNS on <tt>localhost</tt>, late-binding
        lookups only when traffic is sent (e.g., <tt>TCP SYN</tt>)

      Public key directory.

      Will store private keys if you let them.  
      _(encrypted, possibly using in-browser crypto)_

      Social network proof-of-identity (github, twitter).

      API exists, under rapid development.
