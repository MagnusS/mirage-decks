## Systems Programming 

> It's considered good programming practice to focus
> on compositionality: build software out of small, well-defined
> modules that combine to give rise to other modules with different
> behaviors.
>
> **This is simply too difficult to do in distributed systems. Why?**

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
*-- Marius Eriksen, Principal Engineer, Twitter* *([source](http://monkey.org/~marius/sosp13.html))*


## Complexity Kills You

The enemy is **complexity**:

+ Applications are **deeply intertwined** with system APIs, and so lack
  portability.

+ Modern operating systems offer **dynamic support** for **many users** to run
  **multiple applications** simultaneously.

Almost unbounded scope for uncontrolled interaction!

+ Choices of distribution and version.
+ Ad hoc application configuration under `/etc/`
+ Platform configuration details, e.g., firewalls.


## The Odd Inversion

We build applications in a **safe, compositional style** using
functional programming.

...and then surround it in **15 million lines of unsafe code** to
interact with the outside world.

> With such powerful programming language abstractions,
> why hasn't the operating system disappeared from our
> stack?

## The Past Few Months

* **Heartbleed**: 17% of *all* Internet secure web servers vulnerable to a single bug. Described as "catastrophic" by Bruce Schneier.
* **ShellShock**: CGI, Web, DHCP all vulnerable to code execution. Millions of sites potentially vulnerable.
* **JP Morgan**: 76 million homes and 8 million small businesses exposed in a single data breach.
* **Target**: 40 million credit cards stolen electronically.

> System security is in a disastrous state, and seemingly getting worse.


## Introducing [Mirage OS 2.0](http://openmirage.org/)

These slides were written using Mirage on Mac OSX:

- They are hosted in a **938kB Xen unikernel** written in statically type-safe
  OCaml, including device drivers and network stack.

- Their application logic is just a **couple of source files**, written
  independently of any OS dependencies.

- Running on an **ARM** CubieBoard2, and hosted on the cloud.

- Binaries small enough to track the **entire deployment** in Git!

## Can We Do Better?

**Disentangle applications from the operating system**.

- Break up operating system functionality into modular libraries.

- Link only the system functionality your app needs.

- Target alternative platforms from a single codebase.


## The Unikernel Approach

> Unikernels are specialised virtual machine images compiled from the full stack
> of application code, system libraries and config

<br/>
This means they realise several benefits:
<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1" -->

+ __Contained__, simplifying deployment and management.
+ __Compact__, reducing attack surface and boot times.
+ __Efficient__, able to fit 10,000s onto a single host.

## Mirage OS 2.0 Workflow

As easy as 1&mdash;2&mdash;3!

1. Write your OCaml application using the Mirage module types.
   + Express its configuration as OCaml code too!

           $ mirage configure app/config.ml --unix

2. Compile it and debug under Unix using the `mirage` tool.

## Mirage OS 2.0 Workflow

As easy as 1&mdash;2&mdash;3!

1. Write your OCaml application using the Mirage module types.
   + Express its configuration as OCaml code too!

2. Compile it and debug under Unix using the `mirage` tool.

3. Once debugged, simply retarget it to Xen, and rebuild!

          $ mirage configure app/config.ml --xen
          $ cd app && make depend && make build

   + All the magic happens via the OCaml module system.


## Modular Architecture
 
MirageOS restructures all system components as modules:
 
1. A collection of __module types__, describing the structural "shapes" of an 
   operating system (including device drivers).
 
2. A collection of independent __libraries that implement the 
   module types.__  Only libraries that application needs
   are linked.
 


## Module Types: Devices

```
module type DEVICE = sig

  type +'a io
  type t
  type id

  val id : t -> id

  val connect: id -> [ `Error of exn | `Ok of t ] io

  val disconnect : t -> unit io

end
```

Generic interface to any device driver...


## Module Types: Flows

```
module type FLOW = sig

  type +'a io
  type buffer
  type flow

  val read : flow -> [`Ok of buffer | `Eof | `Error of exn ] io

  val write : flow -> buffer -> [`Ok of unit | `Eof | `Error of exn ] io

  val writev : flow -> buffer list -> [`Ok of unit | `Eof | `Error of exn ] io

end

```

...or any I/O flows in the system.


## Module Types: Inclusion

```
module type TCPV4 = sig

  type buffer
  type ipv4
  type ipv4addr
  type flow

  include DEVICE with
  with type id := ipv4

  include FLOW with
  with type 'a io  := 'a io
  and  type buffer := buffer
  and  type flow   := flow
```

...and they can be composed together into other module types, avoiding
the diamond problem.


## Module Types: Entropy

```
module type ENTROPY = sig

  include DEVICE
  type buffer

  type handler = source:int -> buffer -> unit
  (** A [handler] is called whenever the system has extra entropy to announce.
   * No guarantees are made about the entropy itself, other than it being
   * environmentally derived. In particular, the amount of entropy in the buffer
   * can be far lower than the size of the [buffer].
   *
   * [source] is a small integer, describing the provider but with no other
   * meaning.
   **)

  val handler : t -> handler -> unit io
end
```

Complex driver models can be expressed abstractly
(see [V1.ml](https://github.com/mirage/mirage/tree/master/types/)).


## Module Types: Refinement

```
module type FLOW = FLOW
  with type 'a io = 'a Lwt.t
   and type buffer = Cstruct.t

module type NETWORK = NETWORK
  with type 'a io = 'a Lwt.t
   and type page_aligned_buffer = Io_page.t
   and type buffer = Cstruct.t
   and type macaddr = Macaddr.t

module type ETHIF = ETHIF
  with type 'a io = 'a Lwt.t
   and type buffer = Cstruct.t
   and type macaddr = Macaddr.t
   and type ipv4addr = Ipaddr.V4.t
```

The abstract types can be specialised into concrete
library types for common uses
(see [V1_LWT.ml](https://github.com/mirage/mirage/tree/master/types/)).

## Modules Everywhere
 
Modules are used everywhere in Mirage to describe OS layers: 
 
- For the __whole application/OS__. We have a full 
  implementation of the network stack (including TLS) in OCaml.
 
- Very __flexible approach__ for customising OS stacks for weird applications
  (HTTP over UPnP over UDP...)

- Lots of __separate implementations__ of the module signatures:
  Unix, Xen microkernels, Javascript, kernel modules, ... 


## Writing a component

A Mirage component usually contains:

- a module that __implements a specific module type__: very limited dependencies, usually only on
  the Mirage module types.

- in OCaml, modules can be abstracted over other modules.
  - Such a module is called a __functor__ in ML
  - Functors are a type-safe version of C++ templates.


## Example: Website

```
module Main (C:CONSOLE) (FS:KV_RO) (H:HTTP.Server) = struct

  let start c fs http =
    ...

    let callback conn_id request body =
      C.log "HTTP request received" ...
      >>= fun () ->
      let uri = H.Request.uri request in
      dispatcher (split_path uri)
    in
    let conn_closed (_,conn_id) () = ...  in
    http { S.callback; conn_closed }

end
```

## Writing a component

A Mirage component usually contains:

- code parameterised by functors: very limited dependencies, usually only on
  the Mirage module types.  __No OS dependencies__.

- a collection of libraries where the functors are (fully or partially) applied,
  suitable for interactive use.

> Functors clearly separate the dependencies between OS components
> and break down the monolithic into components.


## Configuration: Website

Your server is just an OCaml function.

```
let server =
  let conduit = conduit_direct (stack default_console) in
  http_server (`TCP (`Port 80)) conduit

let main = foreign "Dispatch.Main"
  (console @-> kv_ro @-> http @-> job)

let () =
  register "www" [ main $ default_console $ fs $ server ]
```

This configuration is evaluated at compilation time to generate a main entry point
for that _particular_ setup.


## Correspondence

Configuration Code:

```
let server =
  let conduit = conduit_direct (stack default_console) in
  http_server (`TCP (`Port 80)) conduit

let main = foreign "Dispatch.Main"
  (console @-> kv_ro @-> http @-> job)
```

Application Code:

```
module Main (C:CONSOLE) (FS:KV_RO) (S:Cohttp_lwt.Server) = struct

  let start c fs http = ...
```


## Correspondence: Unix

```
module Stackv41 = Tcpip_stack_socket.Make(Console)
module Conduit1 = Conduit_mirage.Make(Stackv41)
module Http1 = HTTP.Make(Conduit1)
module M1 = Dispatch.Main(Console)(Static1)(Http1.Server)
```

Fairly simple application of a kernel socket C binding to a network stack, which is passed to the application.


## Correspondence: Xen

A more complex module assembly for Xen...

```
module Stackv41 = struct
  module E = Ethif.Make(Netif)
  module I = Ipv4.Make(E)
  module U = Udpv4.Make(I)
  module T = Tcpv4.Flow.Make(I)(OS.Time)(Clock)(Random)
  module S = Tcpip_stack_direct.Make(Console)(OS.Time)(Random)(Netif)(E)(I)(U)(T)
  include S
end
module Conduit1 = Conduit_mirage.Make(Stackv41)
module Http1 = HTTP.Make(Conduit1)
module M1 = Dispatch.Main(Console)(Static1)(Http1.Server)

...

let () =
  OS.Main.run (join [t1 ()])
```


## Flexibility

Website can now be assembled via host code:

* Xen unikernel with all data built into image.
* Xen unikernel with data dynamically read from disk.
* Unix binary with data passed through to filesystem.
* Unix binary with OCaml userlevel TCP/IP stack
* and an emerging JavaScript model: [H261 Decoding](http://andrewray.github.io/iocamljs/oh261.html).

## Git Your Own Cloud

Unikernels are **small enough to be tracked in GitHub**. For example, for the
[Mirage website](http://openmirage.org/):

1. Source code updates are merged to **[mirage/mirage-www](https://github.com/mirage/mirage-www)**;

2. Repository is continuously rebuilt by
  **[Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org/mirage/mirage-www)**; if successful:

3. Unikernel pushed to  **[mirage/mirage-www-deployment](https://github.com/mirage/mirage-www-deployment)**

4. Cloud toolstack spawns VMs based on pushes there.

**Our *entire* cloud-facing deployment is version-controlled from the source code
up**!


## Implications

**Historical tracking of source code and built binaries in Git(hub)**.

+ `git tag` to link code and binary across repositories.
+ `git log` to view deployment changelog.
+ `git pull` to deploy new version.
+ `git checkout` to go back in time to any point.
+ `git bisect` to pin down deployment failures.


## Implications

Historical tracking of source code and built binaries in Git(hub).

**Low latency deployment of security updates**.

+ No need for Linux distro to pick up and build the new version.
+ Updated binary automatically built and pushed.
+ Pick up latest binary directly from repository.
+ Statically type-checked language prevents classes of attack.


## Implications

Historical tracking of source code and built binaries in Git(hub).

Low latency deployment of security updates.

**Unified development for cloud and embedded environments**.

+ Write application code once.
+ Recompile to swap in different versions of system libraries.
+ Use compiler optimisations for exotic environments.


## Jitsu?

What should a unikernel hosting service look like?<br />We're finding out! <https://github.com/MagnusS/jitsu>

- __Fast boot__ + __Git Workflow__ == unikernel CDN!

  - DNS unikernel responds to request
  - HTTPS unikernel spins up in 20ms (x86) or 150ms (ARM)
  - Unikernels spins down upon DNS TTL

- __Challenges__:
  - Balancing the per-VM isolation resource requirements _vs_ session scalability for many connections. 
  - DNS can route between Xen unikernels or Unix services.


## OPAM: Source Management

A library OS needs good package management: <https://opam.ocaml.org>

* __No upper bounds__ packages, and continuous integration to pick 
  up violations.
* __Distributed git workflow__ for feature branches.
* __External constraint solver__ support via CUDF (can use Debian tools
  such as aspcud).

> Every single Mirage library is distributed via OPAM, and many are
> usable in normal Unix (via Lwt/Async) due to functors.

## Ongoing Stuff

Mirage OS 2.0 is an important step forward, supporting **more**, and **more
diverse**, **backends** with much **greater modularity**.

For information about the many components we could not cover here, see
[openmirage.org](http://openmirage.org/blog/):

+ __[Irmin](http://openmirage.org/blog/introducing-irmin)__, Git-like
  distributed branchable storage.
+ __[OCaml-TLS](http://openmirage.org/blog/introducing-ocaml-tls)__, a
  from-scratch native OCaml TLS stack.
+ __[Vchan](http://openmirage.org/blog/update-on-vchan)__, for low-latency
  inter-VM communication.
+ __[Ctypes](http://openmirage.org/blog/modular-foreign-function-bindings)__,
  modular C foreign function bindings.
+ __[Profiling](http://roscidus.com/blog/blog/2014/10/27/visualising-an-asynchronous-monad/)__
  via a visualisation tool.


## Get Involved!

Unikernels are an incredibly interesting way to code functionally at scale.
Nothing stresses a toolchain like building a whole OS.

- **Choices**: [Mirage OS](http://openmirage.org) in OCaml, [HaLVM](http://halvm.org) in Haskell, Rump Kernels or OSv for compatibility, ClickOS for routing.
- **Scenarios**: Static websites, dynamic content, custom routers.
- **Performance**: There's no hiding behind abstractions.  HalVM *vs* Mirage is a fun contest in evaluating abstraction cost.

> Most important: need contributors to build the library base of safe protocol implementations (TLS has been done!)


## Why? [nymote.org](http://nymote.org/)

We need to claim control over our online lives rather than abrogate it to
_The Cloud_:

+ Doing so means we **all** need to be able to run **our own infrastructure**.

+ **Without** having to become (Linux) **sysadmins**!

+ How can we achieve this?

> Mirage/ARM is the foundation for building **personal clouds**, securely
> interconnecting and synchronising our devices.
